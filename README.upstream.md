# Upstream README

This is the README of [BrandonKowalski/slot](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot) — the
project this fork is based on — reproduced **verbatim and unmodified** from commit
[`4345cb8b`](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/commit/4345cb8bdb), which is the commit this
fork branched from. (The only difference is a newline at the end of the file, which upstream's copy
does not have.)

It is kept here in full, and untouched, so that the fork's own [`README.md`](README.md) can speak
for the fork without either rewriting the author's words or passing them off as the fork's own.
Everything below is **Brandon T. Kowalski's** writing and describes **upstream's release**, not
this fork.

Where this file and the fork's README disagree, the fork's README is the one describing what this
build does. The differences are in the controls (four `SELECT` chords are added), in what lives
under `System/` (fonts, cheats, remap, and the display settings), and in where the binary comes
from (this fork publishes source and no release). See [`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md) for the detail, and
[`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) for origin and licensing.

# slot.

A bespoke, GBA-only frontend for the Anbernic RG SP.

## Controls

A `/` means either one. A `+` means both together.

Closing the lid writes a save state and turns off the display. Open it again and you're
back in the game. Leave it shut for three minutes and slot powers off, resuming from that
save state on the next boot.

The lid is not a sleep. The panel goes dark but the board keeps running, which is why the
three minutes exist rather than an indefinite standby.

## SD Card Layout

```
BIOS/         gba_bios.bin, optional. Absent means mGBA's own high level BIOS.
Games/        .gba roms.
Labels/       <rom stem>.png, drawn on the cartridge face. Absent means a text only label.
Saves/        .sav and .srm battery saves.
States/       <core>/<rom stem>/, save state rings ten deep per cart.
System/       the binary, both cores, theme.txt, and selected_core.ini.
Wallpapers/   .png, one picked at random each boot and drawn behind the shelf.
```

Label art is drawn at 196x86, or about 2.28:1. Anything else is scaled to cover that box
and centre cropped, so a square or portrait image loses its top and bottom. Bigger art is
fine and comes down to size; smaller gets stretched up and shows it.

`System/theme.txt` is entirely optional and controls the appearance of the slot:

```
housing #24242a
recess  #1a1a1e
opening #050508
edge    #4d4d57
```

`System/selected_core.ini` is entirely optional and names which core a cart's save states
belong to, one `<rom stem> = <core>` per line. Every cart defaults to mGBA, and states are
kept apart per core under `States/<core>/<rom stem>/` so switching cores later never mixes
one core's save with another's. Both cores ship in `System/`, so naming `gpsp` actually
switches emulators for that cart — gpSP exists for the serial link hardware mGBA's libretro
build does not carry:

```
Emerald = gpsp
```

## Installing on your RG SP

1. Download the latest [AGS-102](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/AGS-102) `.img` release.
2. Use Raspberry PI Imager, RUFUS, et. al. to write the `.img` to an SD Card.
3. Insert this SD Card into Slot 1 of your RG SP. This is the one on the side of the device next to the volume buttons.
4. Download the latest slot release from this repo.
5. Unzip the download
6. Copy all the contents of the zip to a second SD Card
7. Add Games, Saves, BIOS (if you like the boot animation), etc.
8. Insert this SD Card into Slot 2. This is on the side where the power and reset buttons live.

## Updating
I doubt I am gonna work on this more and add to it but in case I do here is how you update.

1. Power off your RG SP.
2. Eject SD Card 2.
3. Connect to your computer.
4. Replace the `System` folder with the `System` folder contained in the update zip.
5. Done.


## Credits

Emulation is [mGBA](https://mgba.io) by endrift, and [gpSP](https://github.com/libretro/gpsp)
by Gilead "Exophase" Kutnick — a cart's `System/selected_core.ini` picks between them, gpSP
for the serial link hardware mGBA's libretro build does not carry — both through
[libretro](https://www.libretro.com). The release ships both cores' compiled libretro
binaries unmodified: mGBA's under MPL-2.0, gpSP's under GPL-2.0. Their license texts, and
gpSP's own corresponding source (fetched at build time and shipped alongside the binary, per
GPL-2.0 section 3(a)), are in [`licenses/`](licenses/), which `dist:device` copies into the
shipped tree alongside the cores they cover.

The device boots [AGS-102](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/AGS-102), a purpose-made fork
of [BaseOS](https://github.com/pvaibhav/BaseOS) by @pvaibhav.

Type is [Open Sans](https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans), under the SIL Open Font
License, and [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) symbols by Ryan L. McIntyre, under MIT.

The panel mask is derived from LCD3x, a public-domain shader by Gigaherz in the libretro
shader collection. At exactly 3x it reduces to a 3 by 3 table, which is what ships here
rather than the shader.

The cart sounds are a recording of me shoving a cartridge into my childhood GBA.

## AI Disclosure

The Rust frontend was put together by Claude Opus. I reviewed everything that was
produced. This documentation is 100% free-range, meatbag prose.

The project is extremely low stakes. I wanted a bespoke frontend for my RG SP and thought
that something this focused on GBA would be kind of neat.

This is just a glorified wrapper around mGBA, which is the real star of the show.

Provided without support. I will selectively address filed issues and PRs.

Use it, don't use it, I don't care. Figured I should share the end result of all the
wasted water.
